# Bitloop Calculator (Java)

Requires JDK

Compile
`javac I.java`

Run
`java I`

Enter a value for *n*, and the program outputs a .csv file with properties of the power set of *n*. Execution time gets very long for values of *n* higher than 20, mostly due to the chainReps method that finds one representative bitloop for every chain that partitions a power set. There are two versions of chainReps, v1 and v2, and one may be faster than the other depending on the value of *n*.

The table below gives the time (in seconds unless otherwise noted) to execute the program for some value *n* on my MacBook. max-cycle-order is the maximum cycle order comparing chains in the power set, and cycle order is how many bitloops are in a chain's cycle. Larger power sets mostly consist of many isometric chains having the maximum cycle order.
